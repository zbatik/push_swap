# push_swap
## A 42 algorithms I project
### Overview
The objective of push_swap is to design and implement an algorithm to sort a stack of unique integers gives a limited
set of stack operations. The objective was to have an algorithm that would minimise the number of stack operations required to sort the stack.
### Usage
to create the binaries:
```
make
```
to list the moves required to sort the stack
```
push_swap [-c] [-v] [numbers]
```
-c for color
-v for verbose
